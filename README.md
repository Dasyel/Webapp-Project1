# B-aware #

+   __Title__:     B-Aware

+   __Summary__:   A simple game in which the user gets to see a picture (or video) for a limited time and afterwards 
gets a question about the picture. This means the user will have to try to take in as much information as 
possible about the picture to be able to answer the question without being able to see the picture again.

+   __Features__:   
 -  Create/delete account
 -  Login/logout
 -  Show user statistics
 -  Show leaderboards
 -  Possibility for users to create own questions
 -  Manage questions (add/delete/edit)
 -  Manage account (change password etc.)
 -  The game itself providing random questions until user quits
 -  Feedback system to get rid of trash questions
 
+   __Used Resources__: 
 -  *CodeIgniter 2.1.4*, although *Ruby on Rails* is encouraged it is not required and *RoR* is already getting on my nerves 
 as I am used to *PhP* frameworks like *CodeIgniter* and *CakePhP*. Because I like a sense of control I prefer *CI*
 over *Cake* and *RoR*.
 -  *JQuery Mobile* for the front-end.
 
+   __Mockups__:
